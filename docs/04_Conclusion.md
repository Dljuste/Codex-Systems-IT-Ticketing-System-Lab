- Practiced real-world troubleshooting, escalation, and documentation workflows.

### 🧠 Skills Strengthened
- Virtualization and cloud administration  
- ITSM and ticket lifecycle management  
- System configuration and Active Directory integration  
- Technical documentation and incident reporting  

**Result:**  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of IT service management environments and the ability to simulate enterprise-level helpdesk operations across multiple platforms.
