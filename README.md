# Codex Systems: IT Ticketing System Lab

This project expands the fictional **Codex Systems** IT environment by implementing two service desk platforms — **osTicket** and **Spiceworks** — hosted on **Microsoft Azure virtual machines** and **VMware**.

The purpose of this lab was to simulate real-world IT service management (ITSM) by documenting setup, customization, and end-to-end ticket workflows across both systems.
